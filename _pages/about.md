Hi! I am **Zixun Xiong**, a Ph.D. student in **Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)**.  
I am currently at **Stevens Institute of Technology**, and will join **George Mason University (GMU) ECE** as a Ph.D. student (RA) in Spring 2026.  
My research focuses on the **security and reliability of AI systems**, especially large language models (LLMs).
